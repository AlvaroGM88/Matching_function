S. 1471
To require digital engineering as a core competency of the Armed Forces,
and for other purposes.
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
MAY 15, 2019
Mr. HEINRICH (for himself and Mr. PORTMAN) introduced the following bill;
which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Armed Services
A BILL
To require digital engineering as a core competency of the
Armed Forces, and for other purposes.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives 
of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Armed Forces Digital
Advantage Act’’.
SEC. 2. DIGITAL ENGINEERING AS A CORE COMPETENCY
OF THE ARMED FORCES.
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following findings:
(1) The National Defense Strategy states that
the Department of Defense will need to ‘‘emphasize
new skills and complement our current workforce
with information experts, data scientists, computer
programmers, and basic science researchers and engineers—to 
use information, not simply manage it.
The Department will also continue to explore
streamlined, non-traditional pathways to bring critical 
skills into service, expanding access to outside
expertise’’.
(2) The Department workforce is challenged in
its ability to develop, use, update, and store digital
information.
(3) Transformational technologies, including
Artificial Intelligence, 5G telecommunications services, and cloud computing, are presenting new opportunities 
and challenges for the Department.
(4) Department modernization programs depend almost entirely on the integration of state-of-the-art software, 
data, and information technology,
and will require a workforce that understands digital
engineering.
(5) The establishment of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center 
(JAIC) in 2018 was an important
step to accelerate the delivery of, and scale the Department-wide impact of, artificial intelligence–enabled capabilities, and a workforce experienced in
computer sciences and digital engineering will be
critical to the success of the Center and the Department.
(6) The Defense Innovation Board stated that,
in order to fulfill its mission in the future, the Department 
will need a ‘‘human capital strategy that
will ensure that DoD can grow and maintain adequate 
computer science capability and capacity for
the wide range of software-centric requirements that
are unmet today and will only continue to grow’’.
(b) POLICY.—
(1) IN
GENERAL.—It
shall be a policy of the
Armed Forces to promote and maintain digital engineering as a core competency of the Armed Forces,
which policy shall be achieved by—
(A) the recruitment, development, and
incentivization of retention in and to the Armed
Forces of individuals with aptitude, experience,
proficient expertise, or a combination thereof in
digital engineering;
(B) the development and maintenance of
multiple career tracks on digital engineering,
and related digital competencies (including data
science, machine learning, software engineering,
software product management, and artificial intelligence 
product management) for members of
the Armed Forces, including the development
and maintenance of training, education, talent
management, incentives, and promotion policies
in support of members at all levels of such career 
tracks; and
(C) the development and application of appropriate 
readiness standards and metrics to
measure and report on the overall capability,
capacity, utilization, and readiness of digital engineering 
forces to develop and deliver operational capabilities and employ modern business
practices.
(2) DIGITAL
purposes of
this section, digital engineering is the discipline and
set of skills involved in the creation, processing,
transmission, integration, and storage of digital
data.
(c) RESPONSIBILITY.—
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The
Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness shall be responsible 
for the development and discharge of the policy
set forth in subsection (a), and shall carry out such
responsibility through an officer or employee of the
Department of Defense assigned by the Under Secretary 
for that purpose.
(2) DESIGNATION.—The individual assigned
pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be known as the
‘‘Chief Digital Engineering Recruitment and Management 
Officer of the Department of Defense’’ (in this section referred to as the ‘‘Officer’’).
(3) DURATION
OF POSITION.—The
requirement
for the Officer under paragraph (1) shall expire on
September 30, 2029.
(d) DUTIES.—In developing and providing for the
discharge of the policy set forth in subsection (a), the 
Officer shall, in close consultation with the Assistant 
Secretaries of the military department for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, 
do the following:
(1) Develop for, and enhance within, the recruitment programs of the Armed Force various core
initiatives, programs, activities, and mechanisms,
tailored to the unique needs of each Armed Force,
to identify and recruit to the Armed Forces individuals with demonstrated aptitude, interest, proficient
expertise, or a combination thereof in digital engineering particularly, and in science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics (STEM) generally, including initiatives, programs, activities, and mechanisms 
to target populations of individuals not typically 
aware of opportunities in the Armed Forces for
a digital engineering career.
(2) Establish one or more flexible career tracks
and identifiers for digital engineering and related
digital competencies tailored to the unique needs for
each Armed Force, including appropriate military
occupational specialties (MOS) and meaningful opportunities 
for career development, talent management, 
and promotion within such career tracks.
(3) Develop and maintain education, training,
doctrine, rotational opportunities, and professional
development activities to support members of the
Armed Forces at each level of each career track established 
pursuant to paragraph (2).
(4) Coordinate and synchronize digital force management activities throughout the Department
of Defense, advise the Secretary of Defense on all
matters pertaining to the health and readiness of
digital forces, convene a Department-wide executive
steering group, and submit to Congress an annual
report on the readiness of digital forces and progress
toward achieving the policy set forth in subsection
(5) Create a Department-wide mechanism to
track digital expertise in the workforce, develop and
maintain organizational policies, strategies, and
plans sufficient to build, maintain, and refresh internal 
capacity at scale, and report to the Secretary

forces.
(6) Assist the military departments in designing, 
developing, and executing programs and incentives to retain, track, and oversee digital expertise
